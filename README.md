# SymmetryTest

Code developed during the final project in my M.Sc. in Mathematics. It performs a bootstrap nonparametric test for certain distribution symmetries. It is not a user ready version. The pdf file contains the written report of the project in which the theory behind the test is explained and the results obtained using it for different data are analyzed.

## How to use it?

Run the code for the Legendre polynomial corresponding to the dimension of your data (from 2 to 5 dimensions in the current version). Once the polynomials are selected, the data can be loaded or one of the example data can be used. Then the blosk of code corresponding to the bootstraptest itself can be run, with two options available depending on the desired symmetry to be tested. The final result will be the p-value of the test.
